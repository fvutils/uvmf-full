# uvmf-full
Full UVM Framework snapshot, including docs

The UVM Framework is a set of base UVM components and automation 
scripts created by Siemens EDA. Find more information, including
tutorial videos and release snapshots here:

Note: this repository is just a snapshot of code from the 
link above to simplify incorporation of UVMF-based testbenches
into IVPM-based projects (ie to prevent the need to cache
UVMF core code in multiple projects). The releases on the 
page listed above is the authoritative source.
